Requirements
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If there are details I have omitted, it is because I will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution.
1.	Create a browser or native-app-based application to serve as a basic weather app.
2.	Search Screen
a.	Allow customers to enter a US city
b.	Call the openweathermap.org API and display the information you think a user would be interested in seeing. Be sure to has the app download and display a weather icon.
c.	Have image cache if needed
3.	Auto-load the last city searched upon app launch.
4.	Ask the User for location access, If the User gives permission to access the location, then retrieve weather data by default


iOS
For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, having the Pods included in the code commits as the source is recommended. (Even though it goes against the CocoaPod's general rules). 
Be sure to use safe area insets 
Using Sizeclass wisely for landscape and portrait  
Make sure to use UIKit, we would love to see a combination of both UIKit and SwiftUI if you desire.
